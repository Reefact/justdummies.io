The xUnit **v3** adapter. It contributes exactly one thing — a `[Reproducible]` attribute — and that
one thing removes the need to wrap any test body in `Any.Reproducibly`.

## Install

```bash
dotnet add package JustDummies.Xunit
```

It depends on `JustDummies` and on xUnit v3.

## The whole surface

`ReproducibleAttribute`, with a settable `Seed`. That is all of it — the adapter is deliberately thin,
because everything it needs already exists in the library
([ADR-0018](https://github.com/Reefact/just-dummies/blob/cli-v1.1.0-beta.3/doc/handwritten/for-maintainers/adr/0018-adapt-dummies-to-xunit-v3-through-a-companion-package.md)).

## Using it

<!-- jd:declarations -->
```csharp
public sealed class DiscountTests {

    [Fact, Reproducible]
    public void A_discount_never_produces_a_negative_price() {
        decimal amount     = Any.Decimal().Between(0m, 10_000m).WithScale(2).Generate();
        int     percentage = Any.Int32().Between(0, 100).Generate();

        Assert.InRange(Discount.Apply(amount, percentage), 0m, amount);
    }

}

internal static class Discount {

    public static decimal Apply(decimal amount, int percentage) {
        return amount - (amount * percentage / 100m);
    }

}
```

The attribute applies at three levels, and the most specific one wins for the duration of a test:

<!-- jd:declarations -->
```csharp
// On a class: every test it declares is reproducible.
[Reproducible]
public sealed class OrderTests {

    [Fact]
    public void An_order_reference_keeps_its_prefix() {
        string reference = Any.String().StartingWith("ORD-").WithLength(12).Generate();

        Assert.StartsWith("ORD-", reference);
    }

    // On a method, replaying a reported seed — the outer level is restored afterwards.
    [Fact, Reproducible(Seed = 1743029518)]
    public void A_quantity_stays_in_range() {
        Assert.InRange(Any.Int32().Between(1, 100).Generate(), 1, 100);
    }

}
```

It also applies to a whole assembly, which is the form to reach for when reproducibility should be
the default for a suite. Put this at the top of any file in the test project, before any namespace
or type declaration:

<!-- jd:skip -->
```csharp
[assembly: Reproducible]
```

## What it does, precisely

Before each test **case**, the attribute opens the same ambient seed scope
`Any.Reproducibly` uses, pinning a fresh seed — or the one you set on `Seed`. After the test, it
closes the scope and, **only if the test failed**, writes the seed to the test's output:

```text
[JustDummies] These arbitrary values were seeded with 1743029518. Reproduce this run with [Reproducible(Seed = 1743029518)].
```

Notice that the message names the **attribute**, not `Any.Reproducibly(seed, ...)`. A test pinned
from outside its own body contains no such call, so naming it would send the reader looking for code
that is not there. The adapter supplies its own replay snippet through the second `Any.UseSeed`
overload — the reason that overload exists
([ADR-0017](https://github.com/Reefact/just-dummies/blob/cli-v1.1.0-beta.3/doc/handwritten/for-maintainers/adr/0017-open-the-ambient-seed-scope-to-adapters.md)).

Three consequences worth knowing:

* **One seed per test case**, so each case of a `[Theory]` gets its own rather than sharing one.
* **A green test stays silent.** The seed is a diagnostic aid, not output.
* **`Any.WithSeed(...)` contexts are unaffected.** That context is isolated by design and does not
  draw from the ambient source this attribute pins.

## Replaying a failure

Copy the seed from the failing test's output onto the attribute, run it, and the exact values come
back. Fix the defect, then **remove the pin** — a committed seed turns a varying test back into a
one-case test.

## Things the analyzers will tell you

| Rule | Situation |
| --- | --- |
| [JD010](/docs/analyzers/JD010/) | `[Reproducible]` on a method xUnit does not treat as a test — it pins nothing and looks exactly like the working form |
| [JD007](/docs/analyzers/JD007/) | a value drawn in a `[Reproducible]` class's **constructor**, which xUnit runs before the scope opens, so the reported seed does not replay it |
| [JD008](/docs/analyzers/JD008/) | a theory's data provider drawing at discovery, before any seed is pinned |

## If you use xUnit v2

This adapter targets **v3** only. On v2, use `Any.Reproducibly(() => { ... })` inside the test body —
it gives you the same pinned scope and the same seed report, at the cost of one wrapping lambda. See
[Reproducibility](/docs/guides/reproducibility/).
